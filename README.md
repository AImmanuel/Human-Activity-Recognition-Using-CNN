This project is a replication and experimentation of the research paper, “A vision-based approach for fall detection using multiple cameras and convolutional neural networks: A case study using the UP-Fall detection dataset”, authored by R Espinosa et al., which used optical flow and windowing technique for fall detection. 

This replication study focuses on reproducing the original model’s methodology and architecture, assessing its performance, and interpreting the potential applications in our project. In addition to the replication, we have also undertaken further experimentation. This includes exploring alternative methods of data preprocessing, optical flow and experimenting with 3D Convolutional Neural Networks to potentially enhance model accuracy and robustness.
